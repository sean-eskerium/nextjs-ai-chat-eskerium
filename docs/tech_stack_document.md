# Tech Stack Document for Eskerium Hub

## Introduction

Eskerium Hub is designed as a central platform to streamline workflows for professional teams by integrating communication, task management, collaboration tools, and AI-enhanced assistance. The platform emphasizes adaptability and user-centric design, aiming to unify multiple productivity functionalities within a single interface. Our technology choices prioritize a seamless user experience, data security, and the potential for scaling to meet increasing demands. Our ultimate goal is to create a cohesive environment where teams can manage tasks, documents, and meetings efficiently while leveraging AI for enhanced productivity.

## Frontend Technologies

For the frontend, Eskerium Hub employs Next.js alongside the Fuse React Template to build a dynamic and responsive user interface. These tools enhance the platform with fast-loading, high-performance capabilities. Material-UI is utilized for styling, assuring a consistent and visually appealing design that is easy to maintain and modify. React Router supports dynamic routing, facilitating seamless transitions between various sections of the hub. The choice of these technologies ensures that users have a smooth, intuitive experience, whether they're accessing Eskerium Hub via mobile or desktop. Additionally, Progressive Web App capabilities are integrated to provide offline access, maintaining productivity even without an internet connection.

## Backend Technologies

The backend architecture features Vercel Edge Functions, which offer serverless operations that can handle scale effortlessly. This choice supports the platform's need to process numerous requests concurrently without compromising performance. The database layer is powered by Neon-hosted PostgreSQL, paired with PGVector for vector-based memory storage, crucial for supporting AI-memory-driven interactions. Our backend also includes RESTful APIs for robust communication with the frontend and WebSocket support for real-time data interactions, cementing a reliable foundation for all user activities.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

We deploy and host Eskerium Hub on Vercel, chosen for its optimization capabilities and seamless integration with our development stack. This platform offers a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, automating testing and deployment, thereby enhancing reliability and reducing downtime. Git serves as our version control system, ensuring collaboration and tracking of code changes, which aids in maintaining the quality and consistency of our project. These choices underpin our goals of scalability and ease of deployment, providing a robust infrastructural base that grows with user needs.

## Third-Party Integrations

Eskerium Hub integrates several third-party services to expand its core capabilities. For video and audio conferencing, we are evaluating SDKs such as Mux, Daily, or Twilio to offer low-latency, reliable communications. These integrations enhance our platform's ability to facilitate essential features like screen sharing and real-time video calls. By selecting industry-standard tools for these functionalities, we provide users with seamless communication options that are both familiar and easy to use.

## Security and Performance Considerations

Security is paramount, and Eskerium Hub employs OAuth 2.0 for authentication, ensuring secure access through role-based permissions. Data is encrypted both in transit and at rest, complying with stringent data protection regulations, including GDPR. Regular security audits further bolster our platform's defense against potential vulnerabilities. Performance is optimized through efficient state management, leveraging React Context for global state and tools like Redux or Zustand for complex states, ensuring responsive and quick-loading user interactions.
