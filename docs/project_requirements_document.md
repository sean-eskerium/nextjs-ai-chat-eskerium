# Project Requirements Document for Eskerium Hub

## Project Overview

Eskerium Hub is a sophisticated platform designed to unify communication, task management, and collaboration tools with AI-driven functionalities to enhance workflow efficiency for professional teams. At its core, the platform aims to foster a seamless integration of various productivity functionalities within one centralized, user-friendly interface. By leveraging modern and adaptive technology, Eskerium Hub intends to empower users to efficiently handle tasks, meetings, and organizational knowledge.

The primary purpose behind Eskerium Hub's development is to address the fragmented nature of current professional tools, providing a unified solution that enhances productivity through AI integration and a modular architecture. Key objectives include creating a scalable and secure ecosystem that enhances user productivity and engagement while ensuring comprehensive data protection and compliance with regulations like GDPR.

## In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

### In-Scope

*   **Communication Tools**: Integrated chat, voice, and video conferencing with screen sharing.
*   **Task Management**: Task creation, modification, and tracking, with project timelines and notifications.
*   **AI Assistant**: Task automation, contextual recommendations, and meeting coordination.
*   **Knowledge Management**: Document retrieval and semantic search capabilities.
*   **User Roles**: Defined roles like Administrator, Manager, and Team Member with varying access levels.
*   **User Authentication**: Email registration and OAuth 2.0 for social media logins.

### Out-of-Scope

*   Advanced industry-specific customizations, such as healthcare or finance regulation compliance (beyond GDPR and CCPA).
*   Initial incorporation of external CRM tools or advanced predictive analytics features, planned for future updates.
*   Comprehensive mobile application and expansion for additional use cases not covered in the initial phase.

## User Flow

A typical user starts their journey by logging into Eskerium Hub through secure, role-based access, either via email or social media. Once authenticated, the user lands on a centralized dashboard that offers a unified view of communication channels, tasks, project timelines, and knowledge repositories. The AI assistant is prominently featured to aid users in managing tasks, facilitating communication, scheduling meetings, and providing context-aware recommendations.

As users navigate through the platform, they can effortlessly engage in real-time chat, initiate or join video conferences, and use the AI assistant to automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows. The intuitive interface is designed to lead users to key functionalities like task management and document retrieval with minimal friction, ensuring an efficient and productive user experience.

## Core Features

*   **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure login with email and OAuth 2.0 for major social media platforms.
*   **Real-Time Communication**: Chat, video conferencing with screen sharing, and thread-specific messaging.
*   **Task and Project Management**: Task CRUD operations, project timelines, and automated notifications.
*   **AI Assistance**: Task automation, contextual recommendations, meeting scheduling, and document management.
*   **Knowledge Management**: AI-based semantic search and version control for organizational documents.
*   **User Roles and Access**: Hierarchical roles with specific permissionsâ€”Administrator, Manager, and Team Member.

## Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend**: Next.js using Fuse React Template and Material-UI for styling.
*   **Backend**: Vercel Edge Functions for serverless operations.
*   **Database**: Neon-hosted PostgreSQL with PGVector for persistent AI memory.
*   **AI Tools**: V0 by Vercel, Vercel AI SDK for AI-driven functionalities, and ChatGPT.
*   **Communication**: SDKs like Mux, Daily, or Twilio for video/audio integrations.

## Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance**: Sub-second response time for core actions and optimal load times.
*   **Security**: End-to-end encryption, OAuth 2.0, and regular security audits.
*   **Compliance**: Adherence to GDPR and CCPA regulations.
*   **Usability**: Intuitive design ensuring ease of use for both technical and non-technical users, with offline PWA capabilities.

## Constraints & Assumptions

*   Dependence on GPT-4 O1 availability for advanced AI interactions.
*   Assumption of existing organizational branding assets to guide initial design choices.
*   Initial build assumes cloud integration primarily for Google Calendar and potential cloud storage solutions like Dropbox.

## Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits**: Evaluate service limits for real-time interactions and plan optimizations.
*   **Data Storage Compliance**: Maintaining compliance with data regulations across diverse geographies.
*   **AI Model Adaptability**: Ensuring AI recommendations remain relevant as organizational data and usage patterns evolve.
