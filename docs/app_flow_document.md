## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

New users typically discover Eskerium Hub through promotional materials, recommendations, or direct organizational invitations, which guides them to the landing page. On arrival, users are presented with an option to create an account, which can be executed via two primary methods: email registration or through social media accounts, utilizing OAuth 2.0 for platforms like Google. Existing users can log in utilizing their email or chosen social media logins with a standard secure authentication process. The onboarding flow also includes assistance for password recovery, wherein users can reset their password by requesting a reset link that is sent to their registered email address. Upon successful registration or login, users are taken to the main dashboard. Additionally, users have the option to log out from their accounts through a dedicated profile or settings menu option.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

Upon logging in, users land on the main dashboard, which serves as the central nucleus for all functionalities within Eskerium Hub. The default view is a visually appealing, intuitive interface segmented into key areas for easy navigation. A sidebar typically houses the main navigation options, including sections for messaging, tasks, meetings, and document management. A top header provides quick access to user settings, notifications, and AI assistance features. The dashboard is equipped with widgets that dynamically update to reflect recent activities, such as incoming messages, pending tasks, and upcoming meetings, offering a quick overview of the user’s current engagements. Users can access detailed views of each component directly from the dashboard, allowing seamless transitions to deeper functionalities within the application.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Setting up a new meeting is straightforward, with options readily available within the meetings section. Here, calendar integrations allow users to coordinate schedules efficiently, and AI-driven tools aid in resolving scheduling conflicts and generating reminders.

Task management allows users to create, update, and track tasks within projects.

Knowledge management is streamlined with AI-powered document retrieval and semantic search features that allow users to access organizational documents quickly. Documents can be modified, version-controlled, and shared seamlessly.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Eskerium Hub is designed to handle potential errors elegantly. In scenarios where users input invalid data, clear and instructional error messages appear to assist in correcting these issues. Network connectivity problems or attempted access to restricted resources prompt fallback pages or modal notifications that guide users on the next steps to restore normal operation. The application provides a smooth recovery, often taking users back to the previous operational page or an alternate workflow path to continue their tasks.
