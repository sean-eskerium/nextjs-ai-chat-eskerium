# API Implementation Status

## Initial Prompt for Assistant
I am working on refactoring and implementing a new API structure in a Next.js application using Redux Toolkit Query. I have access to:
1. The Fuse React demo codebase at [provide path or URL]
2. The Fuse React documentation at [provide URL]
3. The current implementation progress tracked in this file

The goal is to refactor the existing API into a new structure while maintaining functionality. We've already:
- Set up the directory structure
- Implemented error handling
- Created the base API configuration
- Set up the authentication service

Please help me continue the implementation by analyzing the demo codebase and documentation to ensure we follow the same patterns and best practices. The next step is to [specify what you want to work on next].

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created necessary directories for new API structure:
  - `src/app/api/v1`
  - `src/lib/api/services`
  - `src/lib/api/handlers`
  - `src/lib/api/validation`
  - `src/lib/api/errors`
  - `src/store/api/services`

- [x] Implemented error handling:
  - Created error types in `src/lib/api/errors/types.ts`
  - Created error handler middleware in `src/lib/api/errors/handleError.ts`

- [x] Set up base API structure:
  - Created `src/store/api/baseApi.ts` with:
    - Base query configuration
    - Enhanced base query with error handling
    - API service creation with proper tags
    - Type definitions for endpoint builders

- [x] Implemented authentication API service:
  - Created `src/store/api/services/authApi.ts` with:
    - Login mutation
    - Logout mutation
    - Get current user query
    - Proper type definitions
    - Cache invalidation tags

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement additional API services following the same pattern
- [ ] Set up API routes in `src/app/api/v1`
- [ ] Create corresponding handlers in `src/lib/api/handlers`
- [ ] Add validation schemas in `src/lib/api/validation`
- [ ] Implement service layer in `src/lib/api/services`

## Prompt for Continuation
To continue with the implementation, please provide:

1. Access to the Fuse React documentation, specifically:
   - Main documentation showing the API structure and patterns
   - API documentation detailing the endpoints and their specifications
   - Any example implementations or reference code

2. Access to the demo codebase you mentioned, particularly:
   - The API implementation parts
   - How services are structured
   - How the frontend interacts with the API

3. Any specific requirements or preferences for:
   - Authentication flow
   - Error handling patterns
   - Cache invalidation strategies
   - API versioning approach

This will help ensure the implementation aligns with the existing patterns and best practices.
